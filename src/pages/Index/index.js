          Angel Ip was born in Hong Kong, but has been raised and lived in the unceded territories of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and Sel̓íl̓witulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations in the Settler City and State of Vancouver, BC, Canada for most of her life. Angel has completed two diplomas: Hospitality Management diploma at Vancouver Community College and Rehabilitation Assistant Diploma Program at Capilano University. After working in the retail and hospitality industries, Angel found her passion working with people; however, the work was not rewarding and meaningful enough for her. That is when she decided to transition into health care. Angel now works as a rehabilitation assistant in a long-term care home assisting seniors with their exercises to maintain their physical function and she leads therapeutic programs that improve the seniors’ quality of life.

          During Angel’s senior high school years, she suffered from clinical depression that resulted in poor academic performance and she graduated with minimal grades that put her behind the rest of her peers. Through the occupations of self-care, work, and finding her hobbies helped Angel increase her productivity and improve her quality of life. Angel realized her career path to become an Occupational Therapist, and she is currently taking the necessary courses to help her get there. The CUP program at Capilano University is one of the steppingstones to achieve her goal.

          An occupational Therapist to Angel is like an airline pilot. Occupational Therapists are leaders working in a team environment. Communication happens between the Occupational Therapist and the rest of the health care team just like how pilots communicate with each other and the crew. Pilots face the unpredictable circumstances with weather, and Occupational Therapists encounter the unpredictable changes in the health of their clients. Pilots and Occupational Therapists both build resilience and flexibility against the volatility of these situations. Angel is inspired by the strengths of these two occupations and she too, believes she can be resilient through her struggles.
