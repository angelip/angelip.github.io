        <p className="mb-20">
          In my ENGL 100-41 class, we were assigned an argumentative paper to write about in groups of three to five. We are to pick and build on one of the sources that the instructor has provided and come up with a thesis statement of our own. There are six paragraphs in the essay that can be divided among the team.  When it was time to discuss about the paper, I noticed the various personalities of our group. Having different perspectives can bring out fresh ideas onto the paper, but I sometimes find myself in a difficult situation with my group for having opposing opinions. For example, a group member and I argued over the first sentence of the introduction for a couple of hours because we both felt strongly about our opinions and neither of us wanted to compromise. This group assignment taught me about conflict resolution and made me reflect on how I could have handled the situation differently.

          Although this group project did not go as smoothly as I had expected, there is a valuable takeaway from this experience that a conflict may never be resolved. What made me think about this is because I observed myself getting emotionally charged over the situation for trying to reach an agreement with the other person. What I would do differently is gauge the situation and try to open up a space to share my emotions and experience. If the other person is not receptive, I would disengage and move on after expressing that I still respect the other person despite the disagreement and that I have tried to understand their perspective. I would try to maintain as open-minded and respectful as I can.
