      <p className="mb-20">
        In my ENGL 100-41 class, we were assigned an argumentative paper to write about in groups of three to five. We are to pick and build on one of the sources that the instructor has provided and come up with a thesis statement of our own. There are six paragraphs in the essay that can be divided among the team.  When it was time to discuss about the paper, I noticed the various personalities of our group. Having different perspectives can bring out fresh ideas onto the paper, but I sometimes find myself in a difficult situation with my group for having opposing opinions and group members taking on self-proclaimed roles. This group assignment taught me about conflict resolution and made me reflect on how I could have handled the situation differently.

        Although this group project did not go as smoothly as I had expected, I learned to step back from escalating the conflict and moving on to the next task after realizing there is no resolution that will satisfy both ends. What I would do differently is to suggest writing a group contract for my next group project and designating roles of the group to optimize group functioning and to better manage conflict. Moreover, I will try to remain open-minded and respectful if I were to encounter conflict with another group mate again. If the other person is not receptive, I would disengage and move on after expressing my attempt to understand their perspective and my continued respect for the other person despite the disagreements. I believe handling conflict appropriately will provide more positive results and reduce tension in future group projects.
