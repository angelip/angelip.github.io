Angel has completed two diplomas: Hospitality Management diploma at Vancouver Community College and Rehabilitation Assistant Diploma Program at Capilano University. After working in the retail and hospitality industries, Angel found her passion working with people; however, the work was not rewarding and meaningful enough for her.

Occupational Therapists are leaders working in a team environment. Communication happens between the Occupational Therapist and the rest of the health care team just like how pilots communicate with each other and the crew. Pilots face the unpredictable circumstances with weather, and Occupational Therapists encounter the unpredictable changes in the health of their clients. Pilots and Occupational Therapists both build resilience and flexibility against the volatility of these situations.

Having different perspectives can bring out fresh ideas onto the paper, but I sometimes find myself in a difficult situation with my group for having opposing opinions.

What I would do differently is gauge the situation and try to open up a space to share my emotions and experience.
