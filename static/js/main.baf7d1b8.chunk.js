Angel has completed two diplomas: Hospitality Management diploma at Vancouver Community College and Rehabilitation Assistant Diploma Program at Capilano University. After working in the retail and hospitality industries, Angel found her passion working with people; however, the work was not rewarding and meaningful enough for her. That is when she decided to transition into health care. Angel now works as a rehabilitation assistant in a long-term care home where she carries out recreational and exercise therapy programs to help improve the quality of life of the seniors.        "),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"mb-20"},"During Angel\u2019s senior high school years, she suffered from clinical depression that resulted in poor academic performance and she graduated with minimal passing grades that put her behind the rest of her peers. Through the occupations of self-care, work, and discovering new hobbies helped Angel increase her productivity and improve her quality of life. Angel realized her career path to become an occupational therapist, and she is currently taking the necessary courses to help her get there. The College & University Preparation (CUP) program at Capilano University is one of the steppingstones to achieve her goal."),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"mb-40"},"An occupational therapist to Angel is like an airline pilot. Occupational therapists are leaders working in a team environment.

Pilots face the unpredictable circumstances with weather, and occupational therapists encounter the unpredictable changes in the health of their clients. Pilots and occupational therapists both build resilience and flexibility against the volatility of these situations.

There are six paragraphs in the essay that can be divided among the team.  When it was time to discuss about the paper, I noticed the various personalities of our group. Having different perspectives can bring out fresh ideas onto the paper, but I sometimes find myself in a difficult situation with my group for having opposing opinions and group members taking on self-proclaimed roles.

Moreover, I will try to remain open-minded and respectful if I were to encounter conflict with another group mate again. If the other person is not receptive, I would disengage and move on after expressing my attempt to understand their perspective and my continued respect for the other person despite the disagreements.
