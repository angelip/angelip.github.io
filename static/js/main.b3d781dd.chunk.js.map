  Angel Ip was born in Hong Kong, but has been raised and lived in the unceded territories of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and Sel̓íl̓witulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations in the Settler City and State of Vancouver, BC, Canada for most of her life. Angel has completed two diplomas: Hospitality Management diploma at Vancouver Community College and Rehabilitation Assistant Diploma Program at Capilano University. After working in the retail and hospitality industries, Angel found her passion working with people; however, the work was not rewarding and meaningful enough for her. That is when she decided to transition into health care. Angel now works as a rehabilitation assistant in a long-term care home assisting seniors with their exercises to maintain their physical function and she leads therapeutic programs that improve the seniors’ quality of life.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-20\">\r\n          During Angel’s senior high school years, she suffered from clinical depression that resulted in poor academic performance and she graduated with minimal grades that put her behind the rest of her peers. Through the occupations of self-care, work, and finding her hobbies helped Angel increase her productivity and improve her quality of life. Angel realized her career path to become an Occupational Therapist, and she is currently taking the necessary courses to help her get there. The CUP program at Capilano University is one of the steppingstones to achieve her goal.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          An occupational Therapist to Angel is like an airline pilot. Occupational Therapists are leaders working in a team environment. Communication happens between the Occupational Therapist and the rest of the health care team just like how pilots communicate with each other and the crew. Pilots face the unpredictable circumstances with weather, and Occupational Therapists encounter the unpredictable changes in the health of their clients. Pilots and Occupational Therapists both build resilience and flexibility against the volatility of these situations. Angel is inspired by the strengths of these two occupations and she too, believes she can be resilient through her struggles.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      \r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Index;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst AssignmentReflectionsPage = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"page-content pl-70 pr-70 flex-column align-items-center justify-content-center\">\r\n      <div className=\"border\">\r\n        <h1>Education</h1>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

We are to pick and build on one of the sources that the instructor has provided and come up with a thesis statement of our own. There are six paragraphs in the essay that can be divided among the team.  When it was time to discuss about the paper, I noticed the various personalities of our group. Having different perspectives can bring out fresh ideas onto the paper, but I sometimes find myself in a difficult situation with my group for having opposing opinions. For example, a group member and I argued over the first sentence of the introduction for a couple of hours because we both felt strongly about our opinions and neither of us wanted to compromise. This group assignment taught me about conflict resolution and made me reflect on how I could have handled the situation differently.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"mb-20\">\r\n          Although this group project did not go as smoothly as I had expected, there is a valuable takeaway from this experience that a conflict may never be resolved. What made me think about this is because I observed myself getting emotionally charged over the situation for trying to reach an agreement with the other person. What I would do differently is gauge the situation and try to open up a space to share my emotions and experience. If the other person is not receptive, I would disengage and move on after expressing that I still respect the other person despite the disagreement and that I have tried to understand their perspective. I would try to maintain as open-minded and respectful as I can.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default ENGL400Page;\r\n","import React from 'react';\nimport {\n  BrowserRouter as Router,\n} from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nimport ProfileImage from './components/ProfileImage';\nimport PageContent from './components/PageContent';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex-row\" style={{ width: '100vw', height: '100vh', overflow: 'hidden' }}>\n      <ProfileImage />\n      <Router>\n        <PageContent />\n      </Router>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
