Angel has completed two diplomas: Hospitality Management diploma at Vancouver Community College and Rehabilitation Assistant Diploma Program at Capilano University. After working in the retail and hospitality industries, Angel found her passion working with people; however, the work was not rewarding and meaningful enough for her. That is when she decided to transition into health care. Angel now works as a rehabilitation assistant in a long-term care home where she carries out recreational and exercise therapy programs to help improve the quality of life of the seniors.        </p>\r\n      <p className=\"mb-20\">\r\n        During Angel’s senior high school years, she suffered from clinical depression that resulted in poor academic performance and she graduated with minimal passing grades that put her behind the rest of her peers. Through the occupations of self-care, work, and discovering new hobbies helped Angel increase her productivity and improve her quality of life. Angel realized her career path to become an occupational therapist, and she is currently taking the necessary courses to help her get there. The College & University Preparation (CUP) program at Capilano University is one of the steppingstones to achieve her goal.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p className=\"mb-40\">\r\n        An occupational therapist to Angel is like an airline pilot. Occupational therapists are leaders working in a team environment. Communication happens between the occupational therapist and the rest of the health care team just like how pilots communicate with each other and the crew. Pilots face the unpredictable circumstances with weather, and occupational therapists encounter the unpredictable changes in the health of their clients. Pilots and occupational therapists both build resilience and flexibility against the volatility of these situations. Angel is inspired by the strengths of these two occupations and she too, believes she can be resilient through her struggles.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p className=\"mb-20\" style={{ fontSize: '0.75rem', fontWeight: 600 }}>\r\n      I acknowledge that I live, work, and play on the traditional, ancestral and unceded territory of the Coast Salish peoples, including the territories of the xʷməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Index;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst AssignmentReflectionsPage = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"page-content pl-70 pr-70 flex-column align-items-center justify-content-center\">\r\n      <div className=\"border\">\r\n        <h1>Education</h1>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

We are to pick and build on one of the sources that the instructor has provided and come up with a thesis statement of our own. There are six paragraphs in the essay that can be divided among the team.  When it was time to discuss about the paper, I noticed the various personalities of our group. Having different perspectives can bring out fresh ideas onto the paper, but I sometimes find myself in a difficult situation with my group for having opposing opinions and group members taking on self-proclaimed roles. This group assignment taught me about conflict resolution and made me reflect on how I could have handled the situation differently.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p className=\"mb-20\">\r\n        Although this group project did not go as smoothly as I had expected, I learned to step back from escalating the conflict and moving on to the next task after realizing there is no resolution that will satisfy both ends. What I would do differently is to suggest writing a group contract for my next group project and designating roles of the group to optimize group functioning and to better manage conflict. Moreover, I will try to remain open-minded and respectful if I were to encounter conflict with another group mate again. If the other person is not receptive, I would disengage and move on after expressing my attempt to understand their perspective and my continued respect for the other person despite the disagreements. I believe handling conflict appropriately will provide more positive results and reduce tension in future group projects.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default ENGL400Page;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport {\r\n  Route,\r\n} from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport { CSSTransition } from 'react-transition-group';\r\n\r\nimport Index from '../../pages/Index';\r\nimport AssignmentReflections from '../../pages/AssignmentReflections';\r\n\r\nimport ENGL100Page from '../../pages/AssignmentReflections/Assignments/engl100';\r\n\r\n\r\nconst routes = [\r\n  { path: '/', name: 'About Me', component: Index, forHeader: true },\r\n  { path: '/assignmentReflections', name: 'Assignment Reflections', component: AssignmentReflections, forHeader: false },\r\n]\r\n\r\nconst assignmentRoutes = [\r\n  { path: '/assignmentReflections/engl-100-41', name: 'ENGL 100-41 Argumentative Essay', component: ENGL100Page, forHeader: false },\r\n];\r\n\r\nconst allRoutes = [...routes, ...assignmentRoutes];\r\n\r\nconst PageContent = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"flex background-light-grey\">\r\n      {allRoutes.map(({ path, component: Component }) => (\r\n        <Route key={path} exact path={path}>\r\n          {({ match }) => (\r\n            <CSSTransition\r\n              in={match != null}\r\n              timeout={300}\r\n              classNames=\"content\"\r\n              unmountOnExit\r\n            >\r\n              <div className=\"content\">\r\n                <Component />\r\n              </div>\r\n            </CSSTransition>\r\n          )}\r\n        </Route>\r\n      ))}\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default PageContent;\r\n","import React from 'react';\nimport {\n  BrowserRouter as Router,\n  Link,\n} from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nimport ProfileImage from './components/ProfileImage';\nimport PageContent from './components/PageContent';\n\nimport Index from './pages/Index';\nimport AssignmentReflections from './pages/AssignmentReflections';\n\nimport ENGL100Page from './pages/AssignmentReflections/Assignments/engl100';\n\nconst routes = [\n  { path: '/', name: 'About Me', component: Index, forHeader: true },\n  { path: '/assignmentReflections', name: 'Assignment Reflections', component: AssignmentReflections, forHeader: false },\n]\n\nconst assignmentRoutes = [\n  { path: '/assignmentReflections/engl-100-41', name: 'ENGL 100-41 Argumentative Essay', component: ENGL100Page, forHeader: false },\n];\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"main\">\n      <Router>\n      <header className=\"flex-column justify-content-space-between bg-pic color-white\">\n        <div className=\"mt-20 ml-20\" style={{ maxWidth: '30%' }}>\n          <p style={{ fontWeight: 600, fontStyle: 'italic' }}>\n            “You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face.”\n          </p>\n          <p style={{ fontWeight: 600, fontStyle: 'italic' }}>\n            – Eleanor Roosevelt\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"flex-row justify-content-end\">\n          {routes.map((route) => {\n            if (route.forHeader) {\n              return (\n                <Link to={route.path} key={route.path}>\n                  <h3 className=\"mr-30 mb-20 color-two-hover\">{route.name}</h3>\n                </Link>\n              );\n            }\n            return null;\n          })}\n          <div className=\"dropdown mb-20\">\n            <h3 className=\"mr-30 color-two-hover\">Assignment Reflections</h3>\n            <div className=\"dropdown-content mt-20\">\n              {assignmentRoutes.map((route) => (\n                <Link to={route.path} key={route.path}>\n                  <h4 className=\"p-10 mr-30 color-two-hover text-align-center\">{route.name}</h4>\n                </Link>\n              ))}\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        \n      </header>\n      <div className=\"bottom-content\">\n        <ProfileImage />\n        <PageContent />\n      </div>\n      </Router>            \n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
